## Conclusions
- Interest Rate is one of the critical factors that impact the loan charged-off. We see that as the interest rate increases, the charged-off also increases.
- We find that 36 months have a higher loan status charge-off rate than 60  months.
- The instalment affects loan status. As the instalment increases, the loan is likely to be charged off. 
- Verification status is another factor that impacts the loan status. Not Verified has a high charge-off compared to others.
